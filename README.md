## Submitting Your Creations

You all must be used to submitting something after you are done building, but here it is the other way around ( twist... twist ! ).

Here is what to do,

### Step 1
**Fork this repo** This shouldn't need any more explanation but still, you should fork this repo ( use the button above ) to your repository. This should be done by the team-lead and make sure to use the registered GitHub id when forking.

### Step 2 
**Create A Folder** You should create a folder at the root of the forked repo (  preferably on the main branch ). The folder name should be you ***Team Name*** and all your work should be done in it only. Any files created outside this folder will be deleted before evaluation.

### Step 3
**Draft a Pull Request** As soon as you create your folder create a draft pull request to this repo. The title of the PR must be in the format `Team Name | Project Name`. Give us a short description of what you are going to do by filling the pull request template.

### Step 4
**Start Codding** Finally! You can start making your dream project. At this point, our team will be monitoring your progress and giving you timely updates. Try to commit code frequently so that we can get back to you in case of any error.
